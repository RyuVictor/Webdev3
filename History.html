Sinnoh was originally known as the Hisui region.
<br>
According to several myths, this region was the first of all the regions in the Pokémon world to have been created. In a void of nothingness, a single Egg came into being, which then hatched into Arceus, the first Pokémon to be in existence. Arceus created Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, then gave them the abilities to control time, space, and anti-matter respectively. Giratina was banished to another dimension for its violent behavior. Then, during the very early formation of the world, Arceus created Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit to create willpower, knowledge, and emotion respectively, things that are in all modern humans and Pokémon. They dove to the bottom of present-day Lake Valor, Lake Acuity, and Lake Verity, an act which earned them the name "the lake trio". At that point, Arceus created the Hisui region and Mt. Coronet divided the region into two sections. During this violent procedure, Stark Mountain was created and Heatran was formed in lava. Arceus finally created the Adamant, Lustrous, and Griseous Orbs before falling into a never-ending sleep at the Hall of Origin.
<br>
Around this time, Mew was thought to have come into being by itself, containing the DNA of every Pokémon to exist and exist in the future. Human habitation of Hisui is estimated to have begun when Hisui was created, as said in myth. It is stated that Pokémon and humans led separate lives, but always helped each other. They supplied each other with goods, and supported each other. A Pokémon proposed to the others to always be ready to help humans, and that Pokémon be ready to appear before humans always. Thus, to this day, Pokémon appear to humans if they venture into tall grass.
<br>
Pokémon Legends: Arceus depicts the settling of the Hisui region by humans. It was eventually renamed to Sinnoh.
Later on came the events of Floaroma Town. According to the townspeople, Floaroma Town was once a barren and desolate hill. People started planting flowers around it to cheer up the place, but nothing would grow. Then, someone expressed thanks for a blessing of nature, and the whole hill burst into bloom. It is theorized that Shaymin was the cause of the sudden burst of flowers, given it being the Gratitude Pokémon, and its ability to "instantly transform ruined land into a lush field of flowers," according to its Pokédex entry.<br>
In contemporary history, Lucas/Dawn and Barry leave Twinleaf Town in an attempt to see a Pokémon, like the recently reported red Gyarados, in the nearby Lake Verity. After receiving one of Professor Rowan's Pokémon to call their own, their journey begins in earnest, and both Lucas/Dawn and Barry challenge the Sinnoh region's eight Gyms to gain the Badges necessary to challenge the Pokémon League. Along the way, however, Lucas/Dawn is brought into many conflicts with Team Galactic, whose leader, Cyrus, wishes to remake the entire universe in his image with the powers of the Legendary Pokémon Dialga and Palkia. Defeating the team and calming Dialga/Palkia (or Giratina in Platinum canon), Lucas/Dawn challenges Sinnoh's Elite Four and Champion, Cynthia, and becomes Champion him/herself. In Pokémon Platinum, Cyrus accidentally opened a portal to the Distortion World above Mt. Coronet while trying to create a new world for himself. The portal atop Mt. Coronet was able to be closed, but a passageway to this strange dimension still remains in the depths of Sendoff Spring.
<br>
After becoming the Champion of Sinnoh, Lucas/Dawn is contacted by Barry, who they join in taking a ship to the Battle Zone, which is home to the Battle Park (or the Battle Frontier in Platinum canon). Lucas/Dawn explores this island, and also explores Stark Mountain, where they eventually meet and capture Heatran. In Platinum canon, they also aid Looker in stopping Charon, who was here in an attempt to reform Team Galactic and attempted to use Heatran's power to send Stark Mountain into an eruption, alongside the reluctant Mars and Jupiter who defect from the team without Cyrus. Looker then proceeds to arrest Charon and put an end to Team Galactic once and for all.</p>
